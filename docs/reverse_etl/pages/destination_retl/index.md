# Reverse ETL Destinations

DataChannel has pre-built connectors to sync data from a variety of data warehouses to a variety of platforms which include Cloud/SaaS Applications, relational databases, cloud data storages or adhoc files.
Each sync you setup will fetch data from the supported datawarehouses into your selected data platform and in minutes you are ready to start capitalising your data, while DataChannel handles all the details of refreshing your data as per your selected schedule without any intervention from you.
