# Reverse ETL

Reverse ETL transforms your data warehouse into an actionable asset by enabling you to integrate your analytics. It concludes the data integration loop by moving data from the warehouse into a user platform.

1. Create a data model and specify the [data warehouse] from which you want the data for your Facebook Ads. If you have not yet added a data warehouse, go to [data warehouse] tab and add a warehouse.
2. Authorise DataChannel to connect to your data destination using the authentication process described for each.
3. Click on [+ Data Sync] to start adding data syncs to your account.
