# Azure Synapse Data Warehouse

**Experimental**

## Introduction

Azure Synapse is a limitless analytics service that brings together enterprise data warehousing and Big Data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resources—at scale.

Read more about the features and how to get started with the popular platform from Microsoft [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/?source=recommendations).

In case you wish to use this platform to host your data that you are aggregating using DataChannel, this document will show you how you can connect an Azure Synapse based warehouse in minutes using the DataChannel Platform.

> **Prerequisites for connecting your Azure Synapse**
>
> * An active Azure Subscription and an Azure portal Account.
> Set up an Azure Synapse Analytics instance in the Azure portal Account. You need to have access to a resource group for which you are assigned the Owner role. Create the Synapse workspace in this resource group. The detailed steps to create a Synapse workspace in the Azure Portal can be viewed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started-create-workspace#create-a-synapse-workspace-in-the-azure-portal).
>
> * Create a dedicated SQL pool in your workspace. The detailed steps to create a dedicated SQL pool can be viewed [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/synapse-analytics/get-started-analyze-sql-pool#create-a-dedicated-sql-pool).
>
> * If you are using a firewall, please ensure that all the DataChannel IPs are whitelisted. You can refer [here](https://docs.datachannel.co/getting-started/1.0.0/faq.html#_are_there_any_ips_that_need_to_be_whitelisted_in_case_i_am_using_vpn) for a complete list of IPs to be whitelisted.
