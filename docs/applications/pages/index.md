# Data Sources

DataChannel has pre-built connectors to sync data from a variety of data sources which include Cloud Applications, Relational Databases, or ad hoc files. Each pipeline you setup for data from any of the supported sources will create a table in your selected data warehouse and in minutes you are ready to start consuming your data, while DataChannel handles all the details of refreshing your data as per your selected schedule without any intervention from you. You can decide what data to sync with what granularity and how frequently and DataChannel will manage the rest.
