# Naming & Saving Data syncs

**Experimental**

## Naming

It is important to choose a proper descriptive name for the sync as this would allow you to remember the syncs integrated to a platform.

> **Note:** > - You can not start a sync name with digits > - It can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores
